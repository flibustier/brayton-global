                In recent years, we have seen many CIOs structure their I.T.
                department as low-cost technology service providers offering a
                simplified selection of services to the lines of business.
                Focused on increasing efficiency, I.T. has developed and executed
                on tactical projects designed to reduce operational costs,
                standardize processes, consolidate vendors, and comply with
                regulations.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, our observations suggest that the expected benefits
                of the I.T. service provider model often go unrealized.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the market emerge from the financial crisis, new regulatory
                pressures and evolving business models are putting pressure on
                I.T. to further increase efficiency and support rapidly evolving
                business strategies.
              </p>
              <p>
                In our review of I.T. and in discussions with CIOs leading the
                transformation, we have found that firms are reaping significant
                benefits when their I.T. organizations (1) <b>act as innovators</b> 
                and (2) are closely aligned with their business groups. At leading
                firms, I.T. organizations are not relegated to a tactical role.
                Rather, they are strategic business advisors that <b>deliver I.T.
                solutions that enhance products and channels to better serve
                customers, while reducing risks.</b>

                Developing a business case helps your organization to decide which
                path to follow based on a <b>qualitative and quantitative analysis
                </b>. In short, it tells you the who, what, when, where, why and

                getting buy-in from your organization.
